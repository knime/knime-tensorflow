	<shortDescription>
		Reads a TensorFlow saved model from an input zip file
		or directory.

		<intro>
			This node reads a TensorFlow deep learning network from a directory
			or zip file.
			<p>
				If the network should be read from a directory, it has to be a
				valid SavedModel.
				If the network should be read from a zip file, it
				must contain a valid SavedModel.
			</p>
			<p>
				See the TensorFlow documentation for more information on
				SavedModels:

		<tab name='General Settings'>
			<option name="Input Location">
				The path to the input directory or zip file that
				contains the TensorFlow SavedModel. KNIME URLs like
				"knime://knime.workflow/ ... &lt;filename&gt;" are supported.
			</option>
			<option name="Tags">
				The tags identifying the meta graph definition to
				load.
			</option>
			<option name="Signature">
				The signature which should be available for
				executing or training the model. (Use the advanced settings if you
				want to use a signature which isn't available in the SavedModel.)
			</option>
			<option name="Copy deep learning network into KNIME workflow?">
				If selected, the TensorFlow network will be
				copied into the KNIME workflow, so that it is available for export
				with the workflow. Otherwise, only a reference to the actual network
				file is used by KNIME.
			</option>

			<option name='Use advanced settings'>
				If selected, the signature option has no effect anymore but the
				desired signature can be created using the
				<i>Inputs</i>
				and
				<i>Outputs</i>
				options.
			</option>
			<option name='Inputs'>
				Choose tensors which should be available as
				inputs to the deep learning network.
			</option>
			<option name='Outputs'>
				Choose tensors which should be available as
				outputs to the deep learning network.
